# Coolify Self-Hosted Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

Before installing Coolify, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux-based server (Ubuntu 20.04 or higher is recommended).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- A domain name for your Coolify instance (optional but recommended).
  
## Step 1: Install Docker

If Docker is not installed, you can install it using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

Verify that Docker is running:

```bash
sudo docker --version
```

## Step 2: Install Docker Compose

Install Docker Compose using this command:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

## Step 3: Clone the Coolify Repository

Clone the Coolify repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify.git
cd coolify
```

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env` file and make necessary adjustments:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify the `.env` file to match your server and domain settings.

## Step 5: Start Coolify

Start Coolify using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Coolify will now start in the background.

## Step 6: Access Coolify

Once Coolify is up and running, you can access it via your domain or server IP address on port 3000. For example:

```plaintext
http://your-domain-or-ip:3000
```

## Step 7: Set Up SSL (Optional)

To set up SSL using Let's Encrypt, update your `.env` file with your domain name and enable the `ENABLE_SSL` option.

Then, restart Coolify:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

You should now have Coolify running with SSL enabled.
