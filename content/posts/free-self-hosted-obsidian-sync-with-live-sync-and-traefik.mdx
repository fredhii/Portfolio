### Guide: Obsidian with Free, Self-Hosted, Instant Sync

The [LiveSync plugin](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) for Obsidian is one of the best self-hosted services I've set up. It provides seamless, instant, and secure note synchronization across all devices. Since most tutorials skip essential details, I created this comprehensive guide using Docker, CouchDB, and Traefik.

---

### üß≠ Why This Guide?

If you've ever bounced between tools like Notion, Microsoft Loop, or even Apple Notes, you probably know the frustration: great features, but limited control. Maybe you‚Äôve tried Obsidian and loved its local-first approach ‚Äî but hit a wall when it came to syncing your notes across devices *without paying* or *giving up control*.

This guide is for people who want:

- **A secure, private, and self-hosted way to sync Obsidian notes**
- **Full compatibility with desktop and mobile apps**
- **A solution that‚Äôs free, real-time, and encrypted**

We‚Äôll walk you through every step ‚Äî no assumptions, no skipped details. By the end, you'll have a fully functional sync setup using Docker, CouchDB, Traefik, and the Obsidian LiveSync plugin.

Let‚Äôs build your own personal sync server ‚Äî no subscriptions, no black boxes.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This setup includes:

1. **Obsidian App** ‚Äî Installed on each device (Windows/macOS/Linux/iOS/Android). Offline-friendly.
2. **CouchDB** ‚Äî A self-hosted database to store your notes (encrypted). We'll use Docker.
3. **LiveSync Plugin** ‚Äî Connects Obsidian to your CouchDB, syncing in real time.

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- [Traefik v2](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) as your reverse proxy.
- A domain (e.g., `your-domain.com`) and a subdomain pointing to your server (e.g., `obsidian.your-domain.com`).

### üì¶ Step 1: Set Up CouchDB with Docker & Traefik (Your Setup May Vary)

Depending on how your server is configured, this step may look slightly different for you.

> **üí° Note:** This tutorial assumes you're using Docker with Traefik as a reverse proxy. If you're using another reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy), or deploying to a platform like CapRover or Dokku, adapt this step accordingly ‚Äî the core idea is the same: expose CouchDB securely over HTTPS.

```yaml
services:
  couchdb-obsidian-livesync:
    container_name: obsidian-livesync
    image: couchdb:3.3.3
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Bogota
      - COUCHDB_USER=obsidian_user
      - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=YOUR_VERY_STRONG_PASSWORD
    volumes:
      - ./data:/opt/couchdb/data
      - ./etc/local.d:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.d
    networks:
      - traefik-net
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.obsidian.rule=Host(`obsidian.your-domain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.obsidian.entrypoints=https"
      - "traefik.http.routers.obsidian.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
      - "traefik.http.services.obsidian.loadbalancer.server.port=5984"

networks:
  traefik-net:
    external: true
```

> **Note:** üîê Make sure to replace passwords and domain names.
üìÇ Persist your volumes to avoid losing data on container restart.

Then run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> If you're not using Traefik, here‚Äôs what to focus on:
- Ensure port 5984 is accessible via HTTPS.
- Secure CouchDB behind basic auth and a reverse proxy with TLS/SSL.
- Make sure your domain or subdomain (like obsidian.your-domain.com) points to your server and has a valid SSL certificate.


### üåê Step 2: Initial CouchDB Setup

Navigate to:  
`https://obsidian.your-domain.com/_utils/`

1. Log in using your `COUCHDB_USER` and `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Click the `<->` icon in the top-left to expand the sidebar.
3. Select **Setup** from the menu.
4. Click **Configure a Single Node**.
5. Confirm your credentials when prompted.
6. Leave other settings at default and click **Configure Node**.
