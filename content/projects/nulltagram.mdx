Nulltagram is a full-stack Instagram clone - a social media platform that enables users to share photos, interact through likes and comments, and build networks of followers. This project demonstrates modern full-stack development skills using contemporary technologies.

**[Live Demo](https://nulltagram.fredhii.com)**

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Email/password signup and Google OAuth via Firebase Auth
- **Photo Sharing**: Upload and share images with captions using Firebase Storage
- **Social Interactions**: Like/unlike posts, comment on posts, follow/unfollow users
- **User Profiles**: Customizable profiles with bio and avatar upload
- **News Feed**: Paginated feed with posts from followed users
- **API Documentation**: Interactive OpenAPI 3.0 docs at `/docs`

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with Vite for fast development
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing
- **Firebase SDK** for authentication and data management
- **Materialize CSS** for responsive UI
- **Lucide React** for icons

### Backend
- **Node.js 20+** with Express.js
- **Firebase Admin SDK** for server-side operations
- **Cloud Firestore** as NoSQL database
- **Firebase Storage** for image hosting
- **Scalar Express API Reference** for interactive documentation

### DevOps
- **Docker** and Docker Compose for containerization
- **nginx** as reverse proxy for production
- **pnpm** with workspace support for monorepo management

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React + Vite)  <-- HTTP/JSON -->  Backend (Express.js)
     ↓                                            ↓
  Firebase Auth SDK                      Firebase Admin SDK
                                               ↓
                                    Cloud Firestore + Storage
```

The project uses a two-tier architecture with containerized deployment:
- **Frontend Container**: nginx serving React build with API proxying
- **Backend Container**: Node.js Express server
- Both containers communicate via Docker network bridge

## API Endpoints

The RESTful API includes 16+ endpoints:

- **Authentication**: `/signup`, `/signin`
- **Posts**: `/allposts`, `/post/:id`, `/createpost`, `/delete-post/:id`, `/mypost`
- **Interactions**: `/givelike`, `/removelike`, `/insert-comment`, `/delete-comment/:id`
- **Users**: `/user/:id`, `/search-users`, `/follow`, `/unfollow`, `/update-profile`

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nulltagram
cd nulltagram
pnpm install
```

Run the development servers:

```bash
# Backend
pnpm dev

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd ntagram && pnpm dev
```

Or use Docker for production deployment:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Notable Aspects

- **Monorepo Structure**: Uses pnpm workspaces for efficient dependency management
- **Interactive API Docs**: OpenAPI 3.0 specification with Scalar UI
- **JWT Authentication**: Middleware-based token verification on protected routes
- **Production Ready**: Full Docker containerization with nginx reverse proxy
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Vitest and React Testing Library for frontend tests
